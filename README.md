# AOP
A simple script I wrote in C# for my former community, BeyondRP, to set the AOP.

## How to Install
Very easy. Just go into the ``build`` folder and put the .dll and fxmanifest.lua files inside of a folder named ``aop`` in your FiveM server resources!

## JSON Data
This AOP script uploads your server's current AOP to the server's info.json file! This can be found by going to http://iphere/info.json. This also allows you to pull the data into Discord bots or whatever you'd like to showcase your AOP!

## Questions?
Just ask!
